  - The character that the player controls in the game of Hollow Knight.  The Knight
    is a Vessel[1][2] born to the higher beings the Pale King and the White Lady,
    with Void inside their shell.[3] Vessels are stated to be the progeny[4] and spawn[5]
    of the King and Queen of Hallownest; beginning their lives born from eggs which
    are found in an area of The Abyss known as The Birthplace.[6]  Through all references
    and events in-game, the Knight is never once referred to with a gender. This is
    deliberate, as Vessels are genderless beings.[7][8] This fact is made more clear
    by Hornet being called "The Gendered Child"[9][10] leaving her to be the only
    progeny[11] of the Pale King to have a gender.  In the Birthplace cutscene, it
    is shown that the Knight fell back into the Abyss after it was sealed. However,
    at the start of the game, they can be seen wandering around the Howling Cliffs
    after being called back to Hallownest by either The Radiance or The Hollow Knight.[12]
    It is unknown how they managed to escape from the Abyss.  The Knight's resilience
    is born from two voids;[13] one being the Void that the Knight has within them,
    and the other void being the area outside of Hallownest.[14] Spending time in
    this area caused the Knight to lose their memories.[15]  Once the Knight obtains
    Void Heart and remembers their past, they are able to unify the Void under their
    will.[16]They acquired this ability by accepting the Void inside themselves.[17]
    The creature in the area where the Shade Cloak refers to the Knight as the Lord
    of Shades after they gain Void Heart.[18]  At the beginning of the game, the Knight
    is equipped with only their Old Nail and the ability to heal themselves using
    SOUL. Throughout the game, the Knight gains access to new powers and items to
    help them through their journey.
  - He named his Nail "Life Ender" because names supposedly have power. Unfortunately,
    because it is made of shellwood, it cannot deal damage.  While he claims to be
    the strongest warrior in the land, he is found trapped by weak enemies or claiming
    the glory of another bug's deeds. He disregards the Knight as beneath him, and
    accuses them of constantly getting in his way.  Found along the path leading to
    Greenpath. He is held in the mandibles of a Vengefly King, and the player will
    have the choice to either save him or leave him. If saved, he will complain that
    the Knight got in the way between him and his "prey", he will introduce himself
    and boast about his supposed mighty deeds. If he is not saved before acquiring
    the Mantis Claw, he will die in this location.  If he is saved in Greenpath, Zote
    will show up in Dirtmouth, where once again he will talk to the Knight in an arrogant
    fashion.  Zote will be found in a corridor leading back to the storerooms of the
    City of Tears. He will have forgotten the Knight and will introduce himself again.  Found
    stuck in spider webs, presumably having been captured by the beasts of Deepnest.
    Once again the player has the choice to either save him or leave him, though this
    time leaving him will not result in his death. If saved he will once again complain
    about the Knight meddling in his supposed heroics.  If the player saved him both
    times, he will be captured and found in the resting area of the Colosseum of Fools,
    where he will brag about his skills and how his capture was part of his plan.
    He then becomes the final boss of the first trial. As a boss, he deals no damage
    due to his nail being made of shellwood. He simply has to be whacked until the
    fight is over. He is quite inept in combat and regularly messes up his jumps.
    Beating him will reward the player with the 'Rivalry' achievement.  After defeat,
    and after Bretta is rescued, he will return to Dirtmouth with the helmet of a
    Shielded Fool as a supposed "trophy" and claims that he is the new champion, while
    slandering the Knight's reputation. Bretta falls for him, her drawings and dolls
    of the Knight replaced by a single portrait of Zote. Here he will recite "The
    Fifty Seven Precepts Of Zote".
  - The Radiance is a higher being of light similar to Essence[1], and as such opposed
    to the Void, her ancient enemy. The Moth Tribe is born from her light and in return
    revered her.[1] Unlike the individualist society of Hallownest however, the Radiance
    offered unity to bugs at the cost of a mind incapable of thought.[2]  After the
    Pale King arrived in Hallownest and expanded the minds of his new subjects,[3]
    the Moth Tribe turned their backs on the Radiance and worshipped him instead.[4]
    In doing so, the Radiance was almost entirely forgotten from the land. Yet traces
    of her memory remained, such as a statue on Hallownest's Crown. Her memory started
    spreading throughout the Kingdom, by then in its golden age. Soon, all of Hallownest
    began to dream of her, appearing to them as a blazing light.[5] These dreams could
    break the minds of bugs[6] and eventually enslave their wills to hers.[7] But
    the King and his subjects resisted her memory, which started to manifest as the
    Infection.[8]  The Pale King attempted to stop the Infection by sealing the Radiance
    within a Vessel. These creatures, infused with the Void to be without a mind and
    a will, were to be able to withstand the Radiance's influence.[9] The Hollow Knight
    was chosen, raised and grown for that purpose. The Radiance was sealed within
    them, and the Vessel chained within the Temple of the Black Egg. However, the
    Pale King failed to realise the Vessel's impurities of mind.[10] Because of this,
    the Radiance was still able to invade the dreams of bugs. She ultimately wiped
    out the Kingdom of its inhabitants, whose King had vanished, but left the rest
    of the land untouched.  Time passed, Hallownest turned into a myth while the Radiance
    remained sealed. Her influence finally started to break out of the Hollow Knight.[11]
    She reignited the full power of the Infection, threatening again the land of Hallownest[12]
    and prompting the Knight to return to Hallownest.[13]
  - "Before the fall of Hallownest, he used to be Monomon\u2019s apprentice. When
    Monomon became a Dreamer, she entrusted Quirrel with her mask, which was part
    of an additional protection enacted upon herself. Quirrel can be seen wearing
    this mask on top of his head.  In the official comic, it is shown that Quirrel
    ended up outside of Hallownest, causing him to lose much of his memory. He was
    called back to Hallownest by Monomon in order to reverse the protection placed
    on her. After entering the Howling Cliffs, Quirrel meets Hornet, whom he briefly
    fights. Hornet allows Quirrel to enter Hallownest when she recognizes Monomon\u2019s
    mask.  Quirrel can initially be found at the Temple of the Black Egg, but he can
    be encountered in several locations around Hallownest. After helping the Knight
    kill Monomon by removing the protection on her, he goes to Blue Lake to see the
    source of the rain in the City of Tears."
